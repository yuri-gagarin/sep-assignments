1. Spatial locality referes to data with close storage locations. Data in arrays is stored closer together in adjacent memopry blocks. Data with linked lists is farther apart in seemingly random locations

Accessing and creating elements seems to take longer with linked lists. It would make sense then since the data is not adjacent to each other but can be in random spots in memory
