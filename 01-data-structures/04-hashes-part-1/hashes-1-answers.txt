Doubling the size of the array when a collision occurs may seem like a good idea at first, but as the input size grows, with
especially large hashes, the array may become unnecessarily large. If we double the size of the array every time there
is a collision, we can eventually end up with a huge array size of hundreds of thousands? millions? of elements with very
many nil index values unnecessarily eating up memory space
